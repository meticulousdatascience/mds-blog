This blog is written by a pure mathematician turned applied data scientist.

In part because of my mathematical training, and in part because of my personality, I am quite interested in understanding all the details of all the data science. Because this isn't always appreciated or necessary at work, I started this blog as a creative outlet for humoring my meticulous side. I am also very interested in aesthetics, so find myself thinking about data visualization probably more than I should.
