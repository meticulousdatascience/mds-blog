This blog is written by me, Sonya Berg, a pure mathematician turned applied data scientist. You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sonyaberg/). I use this blog to write down details about different topics in data science as I am learning them, as well as code snippets for solving problems that I use all the time so I have a place to find them.
